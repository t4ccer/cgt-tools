# cgt

Combinatorial Game Theory framework and toolkit  in Rust and Python.

## `cgt-gui`

Experimental graphical interface. See [README](./cgt_gui/README.md).

## `cgt-cli` utils

Some of the library features are exposed through CLI utility tool. See [CLI README](./cgt_cli/README.md) for installation and usage instructions.

## Rust Library

[Documentation](https://docs.rs/cgt/latest/cgt/)

## Python library (`cgt-py`)

Available on [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/cgt-py)

Python interface is intended as a thin wrapper for interactive exploration using notebook software like [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) rather than exhaustive searches of large search spaces.

- Library is heavily inspired by https://github.com/aaron-siegel/cgsuite
- Library in Haskell that provides basic functions to work with combinatorial games https://github.com/kamekura/haskell-cgt
